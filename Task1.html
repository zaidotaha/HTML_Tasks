    <p>I finished highschool from Al-Ansar International School in the UAE. I moved to Jordan for university. <br>
    I was a medicine major at first, but I felt that it wasn't the major for me so I switched to Computer Science.<br>
    Now, I am in my final semester and I am working hard to refine my skills for the job market.</p>
